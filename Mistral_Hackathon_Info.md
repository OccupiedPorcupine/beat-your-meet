## 🛠️ Tracks & Competition Rules

You can compete in teams of **one to four people**. There are two primary tracks available:

1. **Fine-tuning Track:** Sponsored by Weights & Biases (W&B). This track offers up to **20 bonus points**. You are expected to fine-tune open-source Mistral models (like the 3B, 8B, or 14B range) and use W&B for tracking and evaluation.


2. **API Track:** The "anything goes" category. Use Mistral’s models via API to build the most creative and impactful project.



### The Golden Rules

* 
**No Prior Work:** Projects must be started during the event. The only exception is **data set preparation**, which you are encouraged to do beforehand if you are in the Fine-tuning track.


* 
**Open Source Requirement:** If you are in the Fine-tuning track, you must upload your model adapters to the Hugging Face organization publicly for reproducibility.


* 
**Ownership:** You retain 100% of the intellectual property for what you build.

## 💡 Pro-Tips for Success

* 
**Scope Small:** It is better to have a polished, working core than a broken, ambitious mess.


* 
**Focus on "Cool," not "Complex":** Judges often prefer projects that feel revolutionary or fun over those that are just technically dense.


* 
**Discord is Key:** Join the Discord server and react to your city's emoji to unlock your local channels for announcements and mentor help.
